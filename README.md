# Chemnitz

> Chemnitz (German: [ˈkɛmnɪts], from 1953 to 1990: Karl-Marx-Stadt, pronounced [kaʁlˈmaʁksˌʃtat]) is the third largest city in the German federal state of Saxony after Leipzig and Dresden. It is the 28th largest city of Germany as well as the fourth largest city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden. The city is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region, and lies in the middle of a string of cities sitting in the densely populated northern foreland of the Elster and Ore Mountains, stretching from Plauen in the southwest via Zwickau, Chemnitz and Freiberg to Dresden in the northeast.

Chemnitz is a bit gray, but therefore the bright spots shine even more.
